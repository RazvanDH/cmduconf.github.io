  <h1 class="title" id="conference_manifesto">Conference Manifesto</h1>

  <p>This conference will focus on iOS mobile applications. The aim is to provide hands on, end to end testing. This means the talks will be selected in order to cover as much parts of any app as possible, from the initial AppDelegate start, to Networking, Database, Controllers, UI. The objective is provide a good start for a non-seasoned engineer as well as deeper insight on a specific topic for more expert engineers. The format will be a conference, but we'll ask the speakers to provide all code related and step by step example on a github repo that you will be able to follow and get deep in. The objective is to get a mix between a workshop and a conference, and be highly technical. Also we'll have a couple of "less technical" conferences to balance the full day.</p>

<div class="section">
  <h1 class="title" id="speakers_manifesto">Speaker's Manifesto</h1>

  <p>As a speaker you are pledged to read and agree to the Code of Conduct and Conference Manifesto and/or to add amendments to improve it if you want.</p>

  <p>You'll be asked to share the code and slides of the conference with the attendees (we'll provide a github account). We also encourage to use an Open Source medium complex project, to help picture any technique in an un-simple scenario. In this matter if you (your company) has a project already you're more than welcome to use it!</p>

  <p>You're also pledged to have fun :-) </p>
