  <article class="post-content">
  <p>More than a year ago I decided to move to London. It was mostly a professional decision.
I realised that not all good developers where american, hardly. There was a huge amount of people from the UK working and doing great things for iOS.
Even before setting foot in London, going to <a href="http://www.iosdevuk.com/">iOSDevUk 2013</a> was a priority for me. It was not a mistake, I met amazing people and learned.</p>

<p>###The meetup</p>

<p>A while after starting my life in London, <a href="http://nslondon.com/">NSLondon</a> meetup was created. I could get to the second meetup. I was amazed. Great people giving out knowledge, a lot, and very valuable (it was all about iOS 7 back then).
A bit later on the train to Aberystwyth I had the chance to met <a href="https://twitter.com/Daniel1of1">Daniel</a>, the creator of <a href="http://nslondon.com/">NSLondon</a>. He’s an amazing guy (I suspect he has clones though, or he doesn’t sleep :D).</p>

<p>After a while going to NSLondon and talking with him I realised something. For me, the best thing of  this meetups is the healthy environment (if you remove the beers :D). It’s a super sharing, ego-free situation where each one shares it’s experience. That still amazes me.</p>

<p>####One more thing…</p>

<p><a href="http://nslondon.com/">NSLondon</a> shows always job offers in a very… original way… a projected TextEdit with a list of emails and company names… but, you know? It works. When I decided to move, thanks to <a href="http://nslondon.com/">NSLondon</a> I could join my current company, <a href="http://lyst.com">Lyst</a>. They didn’t charge anyone and I also got featured in one of the last NSLondon talks :D. Above all, I’m not the only one to get a job thanks to them!</p>

<p>On a modest way to thank, I’ll point you to the conference <a href="http://nslondon.com/">NSLondon</a> is organising: <a href="http://cmdrconf.com/">CMD R Conf</a> on late October, it’s going to be amazing!</p>

<p><em>Addition</em></p>

<p>Today before finishing this post I saw one of the NSLondon talks I missed. It’s a talk from <a href="https://twitter.com/Chilvman">Tim Chilvers</a> on his experience with legacy code and what he learned. I believe it’s the <a href="http://vimeo.com/98274951">ultimate example</a> of what I’m trying to express.</p>
